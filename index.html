    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>As a dedicated web developer with over 1 year of experience, I specialize in creating dynamic
        and responsive websites that enhance user experience and drive engagement. <br>My journey began 
        with a passion for coding, which led me to acquire a strong foundation in HTML,< CSS, and JavaScript.
         Over the years, I've expanded my skill set to include frameworks such as React and Vue.js, as well as 
         backend technologies like Node.js and Express.
        I have successfully collaborated with cross-functional teams on various projects, ranging from e-commerce 
        platforms to portfolio sites, allowing me to refine my problem-solving abilities and adapt to diverse development environments.
         My focus on writing clean, maintainable code and optimizing performance has consistently resulted in improved load times and user satisfaction.
        Currently, I aspire to further deepen my knowledge in full-stack development and explore emerging technologies such as AI and machine learning.
         I am eager to take on challenging projects that not only push my technical boundaries but also contribute to innovative and impactful solutions.
          My goal is to be part of a forward-thinking team where I can grow professionally while making a meaningful impact in the digital landscape.</section>
